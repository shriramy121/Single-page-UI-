                            My name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to start blogging today. I have been
                            building
                            blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and
                            helped
                            hundreds of others do the same. <br>

                            I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. This free guide is all
                            about
                            blogging for beginners, and will teach you how to become a blogger with just the most basic
                            computer
                            skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in 20 minutes. <br>

                            I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of
                            mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat
                            these
                            same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that a complete
                            beginner
                            can

                    So, just how do you start a blog? <br>

                    Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h2>
                    Should you start a blog?
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be
                    successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal
                    perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.
                </p><br>
                <p>And because of the format, many successful bloggers will<b> write about a variety of topics on
                        the same blog</b>.</p> <br>
                <p>
                    In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a
                    successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a
                    food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real
                    meals, mistakes and all.
                </p> <br>
                <h3>To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.
                </h3> <br>
                <p>
                    At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that
                    you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long
                    as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine
                    through and keep your visitors interested.
                </p> <br>
                <p>So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:</p> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Share your story. </h2>
                        <p>
                            A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the
                            entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a
                            diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends,
                            family, and others can all be a part of their lives.
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Make money from home.</h2>
                        <p>Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world
                            obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice
                            profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form
                            of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of
                            content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go
                            into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Recognition for yourself or your business.</h2>
                        <p>No, you probably won’t have paparazzi
                            following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your
                            idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field.
                            Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even
                            gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Find a community.</h2>
                        <p>Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is
                            a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are.
                            Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the
                            opportunity to learn from your readers as well.</p>

                    <p >  My name is Scott Chow, and I wrote the easiest guide to starting a blog, so that you can start
                        your blog today! <br>

                        I was lucky enough to get started working on websites in the early 2000s. This was a time when
                        the internet was just starting to grow. This gave me the opportunity to be part of a very
                        exciting period when things were changing really fast online. <br>
                        And you know what? It hasn’t slowed down since then. Technology keeps changing at a rapid pace. <br>

                        I have seen things come and go, but one of the things that’s stuck around without changing too
                        much is blogging. People love to share their thoughts and ideas, and other people love to read
                        them. <br></p>
